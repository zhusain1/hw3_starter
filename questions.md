## 1. Minimax and Alphabeta

1.1 For the [first game tree on the HW3 page](mm0.png), use the minimax algorithm to compute a value for each non-leaf node. Squares represent max nodes and circles represent min nodes. Indicate which move the maximizing player should make.

*we'll descirbe how you can hand this in later*

1.2 Simulate the alpha-beta algorithm on the [second game tree on the HW3 page](mm1.png), crossing out the nodes that are pruned. For each non-leaf node that is not pruned, show the exact value (e.g., =3) or the last constraint (e.g., <= 2, >=8) that the alpha-beta algorithm determines.

## 2. Game characteristics

For each of the following statements, say whether it is true or false and provide a short (e.g. one paragraph) justification for your answer.

2.1 Given a two-player, turn-taking, zero-sum, fully observable game between two perfectly rational players, it does not help the first player's outcome to know what strategy the second player is using -- that is, what move the second player will make, given the first player's move.

2.2 Given a two-player, turn-taking, zero-sum, partially observable game between two perfectly rational players, it does not help the first player to know what move the second player will make, given the first player's move.

2.3 A perfectly rational backgammon-playing agent with unlimited resources never loses.

## 3. Answer the following questions for our the game of Nim.

3.1 For a Nim game with initial configuration [5,4,3], what is the shortest possible game in terms of plys?

3.2 For a Nim game with initial configuration [5,4,3], what is the longest possible game in terms of plys?

3.3 For a Nim game with initial configuration [H1, H2, ... Hn] where the Hi values are all positive integers greater than 0 and n is greater than 0, what is the shortest possible game in terms of plys?

3.4 For a Nim game with initial configuration [H1, H2, ... Hn] where the Hi values are all positive integers greater than 0 and n is greater than 0, what is the longest possible game in terms of plys?
